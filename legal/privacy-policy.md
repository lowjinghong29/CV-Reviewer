# Privacy Policy for AI CV Coach

**Last Updated:** [Date]

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to AI CV Coach ("we," "us," or "our"). Our service is designed to help students, recent graduates, and career seekers ("you") improve their curriculum vitae (CVs) using artificial intelligence. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our web application (the "Service").

## 2. Information We Collect

To provide our Service, we collect the following types of information:

*   **Account Information:** If you create an account, we collect your email address and a securely hashed password. We may also collect your name or user role (e.g., "Student," "Counselor") if you provide it.
*   **CV Content:** We collect the files you upload (PDFs, DOCX). We process these files to extract text and store the text, the AI-generated review results, and any rewritten versions of your CV.
*   **Usage Data:** We automatically collect information about how you interact with our Service, such as pages visited, features used, and error logs. This data is used for analytics and to improve the Service. It does not include the content of your CV.
*   **Chat Data:** If you use the "CV Coach" chat feature, we collect the messages you send and the AI's responses to maintain conversation history for your session.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use your information for the following purposes:

*   **To Provide the Service:** To process your CV, generate AI-powered feedback and scores, create improved CV versions, and allow you to download the results.
*   **To Improve the Service:** To understand how our users interact with the app, identify bugs, and develop new features.
*   **To Communicate with You:** To respond to your support requests or send important service-related notifications (if you have an account).

## 4. AI Processing with Google Gemini

A core feature of our Service is the use of a third-party AI provider, Google Gemini, to analyze your CV.

*   **Data Sent to AI:** When you upload a CV, the extracted text is sent to the Google Gemini API to generate your review and the improved version.
*   **Purpose:** This processing is solely for the purpose of providing you with the CV analysis features of our Service.
*   **Important Disclaimer:** We do not use your CV content to train our own AI models. For information on how Google handles data, please refer to their policies. We advise you **not to include highly sensitive personal information** in your CV that is not essential for a job application (e.g., national ID numbers, financial information, or health data).

## 5. Data Retention

We retain your data only for as long as necessary to provide you with the Service.

*   **For Registered Users:** Your uploaded CVs and review history are stored for as long as your account is active, allowing you to access them later. You can delete your account and all associated data at any time.
*   **For Guest Users:** Uploaded files and review results are kept for a limited period (e.g., **[24 hours]**) to allow you to complete your session and download your documents, after which they are automatically deleted from our active systems.

## 6. Sharing of Information

We do not sell your personal data. We only share your information with the following third parties as necessary to operate our Service:

*   **AI Provider (Google Gemini):** As described in Section 4, to perform CV analysis.
*   **Infrastructure Providers:** We use cloud hosting services (e.g., AWS, Vercel) to store data and run the application.
*   **Legal Requirements:** We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.

## 7. Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your information, including using encryption for data in transit (HTTPS) and restricting access to our systems. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 8. Your Rights

You have rights over your personal data. Depending on your location, these may include the right to:

*   **Access** the information we hold about you.
